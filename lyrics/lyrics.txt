<a name=aday></a>A day in the life<p>
I read the news today oh boy<br>
About a lucky man who made the grade<br>
And though the news was rather sad<br>
Well I just had to laugh<br>
I saw the photograph.<br>
<br>
He blew his mind out in a car<br>
He didnÂ’t notice that the lights had changed<br>
A crowd of people stood and stared<br>
They'd seen his face before<br>
Nobody was really sure<br>
If he was from the House of Lords.<br>
<br>
I saw a film today oh boy<br>
The English Army had just won the war<br>
A crowd of people turned away<br>
but I just had to look<br>
Having read the book.<br>
<br>
I'd love to turn you on<br>
<br>
Woke up, fell out of bed,<br>
Dragged a comb across my head<br>
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup,<br>
And looking up I noticed I was late.<br>
Found my coat and grabbed my hat<br>
Made the bus in seconds flat<br>
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke,<br>
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream<br>
<br>
I read the news today oh boy<br>
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire<br>
And though the holes were rather small<br>
They had to count them all<br>
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.<br>
<br>
I'd love to turn you on

<a name=ahard></a>A hard day's night<p>
ItÂ’s been a hard da'Â’s night, and I been working like a dog<br>
ItÂ’s been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log<br>
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do<br>
Will make me feel alright<br>
<br>
You know I work all day to get you money to buy you things<br>
And itÂ’s worth it just to hear you say you're going to give me everything<br>
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone<br>
You know I feel ok<br>
<br>
When I'm home everything seems to be right<br>
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight<br>
<br>
Owww!<br>
<br>
So why on earth should I moan, 'cause when I get you alone<br>
You know I feel ok<br>
<br>
When I'm home everything seems to be right<br>
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah<br>
<br>
It's been a hard day's night, and I been working like a dog<br>
It's been a hard day's night, I should be sleeping like a log<br>
But when I get home to you I'll find the things that you do<br>
Will make me feel alright<br>

A little help from my friends<p>
A little help from my friends<br>
What would you think if I sang out of tune,<br>
Would you stand up and walk out on me.<br>
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song,<br>
And I'll try not to sing out of key.<br>
I get by with a little help from my friends,<br>
I get high with a little help from my friends,<br>
Going to try with a little help from my friends.<br>
What do I do when my love is away.<br>
(Does it worry you to be alone)<br>
How do I feel by the end of the day<br>
(Are you sad because youÂ’re on your own)<br>
No I get by with a little help from my friends,<br>
Do you need anybody,<br>
I need somebody to love.<br>
Could it be anybody<br>
I want somebody to love.<br>
Would you believe in a love at first sight,<br>
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time.<br>
What do you see when you turn out the light,<br>
I canÂ’t tell you, but I know itÂ’s mine.<br>
Oh I get by with a little help from my friends,<br>
Do you need anybody,<br>
I just need somebody to love,<br>
Could it be anybody,<br>
I want somebody to love.<br>
I get by with a little help from my friends,<br>
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends,<br>

A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.<br>
<br>
I dream of your first kiss, and then,<br>
I feel upon my lips again,<br>
A taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.<br>
<br>
I will return, yes I will return,<br>
IÂ’ll come back for the honey and you.<br>
<br>
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart,<br>
There lingers still, 'though we're far apart,<br>
That taste of honey... tasting much sweeter than wine.<br>

Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,<br>
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe<br>
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind,<br>
Possessing and caressing me.<br>
Jai guru de va om<br>
Nothing's gonna change my world,<br>
Nothing's gonna change my world.<br>
<br>
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,<br>
That call me on and on across the universe,<br>
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box they<br>
Tumble blindly as they make their way<br>
Across the universe<br>
Jai guru de va om<br>
NothingÂ’s gonna change my world,<br>
NothingÂ’s gonna change my world.<br>
<br>
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing<br>
Through my open views inviting and inciting me<br>
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a<br>
Million suns, it calls me on and on<br>
Across the universe<br>
Jai guru de va om<br>
NothingÂ’s gonna change my world,<br>
NothingÂ’s gonna change my world.

Your day breaks, your mind aches<br>
You find that all the words of kindness linger on <br>
When she no longer needs you<br>
<br>
She wakes up, she makes up<br>
She takes her time and doesnÂ’t feel she has to hurry<br>
She no longer needs you<br>
<br>
And in her eyes you see nothing<br>
No sign of love behind the tears<br>
Cried for no one<br>
A love that should have lasted years!<br>
<br>
You want her, you need her<br>
And yet you don't believe her when she said her love is dead<br>
You think she needs you<br>
<br>
And in her eyes you see nothing<br>
No sign of love behind the tears<br>
Cried for no one<br>
A love that should have lasted years!<br>
<br>
You stay home, she goes out<br>
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone<br>
She doesn't need him<br>
<br>
Your day breaks, your mind aches<br>
There will be time when all the things she said will fil your head<br>
You won't forget her<br>
<br>
And in her eyes you see nothing<br>
No sign of love behind the tears<br>
Cried for no one<br>
A love that should have lasted years!

It's getting better all the time<br>
I used to get mad at my school<br>
The teachers who taught me weren't cool<br>
You're holding me down, turning me round<br>
Filling me up with your rules.<br>
<br>
I've got to admit it's getting better<br>
A little better all the time<br>
I have to admit it's getting better<br>
It's getting better since you've been mine.<br>
<br>
Me used to be a angry young man<br>
Me hiding me head in the sand<br>
You gave me the word<br>
I finally heard<br>
IÂ’m doing the best that I can.<br>
IÂ’ve got to admit it's getting better<br>
I used to be cruel to my woman<br>
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved<br>
Man I was mean but I'm changing my scene<br>
And I'm doing the best that I can.<br>
<br>
I admit it's getting better<br>
A little better all the time<br>
Yes I admit it's getting better<br>
It's getting better since you've been mine.

All about the girl who came to stay?<br>
She's the kind of girl you want so much<br>
It makes you sorry;<br>
Still, you don't regret a single day.<br>
Ah girl! Girl!<br>
<br>
She's the kind of girl who puts you down<br>
When friends are there, you feel a fool.<br>

She acts as if it's understood.<br>
She's cool, cool, cool, cool,<br>
Girl! Girl! [Was she]<br>

When I think of all the times IÂ’ve tried to leave her<br>
She will turn to me and start to cry;<br>
And she promises the earth to me<br>
And I believe her.<br>
After all this times I donÂ’t know why.<br>
Ah, girl! Girl!<br>

She's cool, cool, cool, cool, Girl! Girl!<br>
<br>
Was she told when she was young the pain<br>
Would lead to pleasure?<br>
Did she understand it when they said<br>
That a man must break his back to earn<br>
His day of leisure?<br>
Will she still believe it when heÂ’s dead?<br>

Everybody knows there's nothing doing<br>
Everything is closed it's like a ruin<br>
Everyone you see is half asleep.<br>
And you're on your own you're in the street<br>
Good morning, good morning...<br>
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool.<br>
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school.<br>
Nothing has changed it's still the same<br>
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K.<br>
Good morning, good morning...<br>
People running round it's five oÂ’clock.<br>
Everywhere in town is getting dark.<br>
Everyone you see is full of life.<br>
It's time for tea and meet the wife.<br>
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here.<br>
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear.<br>
Go to a show you hope she goes.<br>

Your voice is soothing, but the words arenÂ’t clear<br>
You donÂ’t sound differnt, IÂ’ve learned the game.<br>
IÂ’m looking through you, youÂ’re not the same<br>
<br>
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? <br>
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight <br>
<br>
YouÂ’re thinking of me, the same old way<br>
You were above me, but not today<br>
The only difference is youÂ’re down there<br>
IÂ’m looking through you, any other way<br>
<br>
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? <br>
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight <br>
<br>
IÂ’m looking through you, where did you go <br>
I thought I knew you, what did I know <br>
You donÂ’t look different, but you have changed<br>
IÂ’m looking through you, youÂ’re not the same

IÂ’m only sleeping<p>
When I wake up early in the morning<br>
<br>
Lift my head, IÂ’m still yawning<br>
When IÂ’m in the middle of a dream<br>
Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)<br>

Please, donÂ’t wake me, no, donÂ’t shake me<br>
Leave me where I am - IÂ’m only sleeping<br>

And after all IÂ’m only sleeping<br>

Keeping an eye on the world going by my window<br>

Lying there and staring at the ceiling<br>
Waiting for a sleepy feeling...<br>

Would you promise to be true<br>

Â‘cause IÂ’ve been in love before<br>

Than just holding hands<br>
<br>
If I give my heart to you<br>
I must be sure<br>

That you would love me more than her<br>

Some forever not for better<br>

In my life IÂ’ve loved them all<br>

But of all these friends and lovers<br>
There is no one compares with you<br>
And these memories lose their meaning<br>

MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<p>
Joan was quizzical, studied metaphysical<br>
Science in the home<br>
Late nights all alone with a test-tube<br>
Ohh-oh-oh-oh...<br>
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine<br>
Calls her on the phone<br>
Â“Can I take you out to the pictures<br>
Joa-oa-oa-oan?Â”<br>
But as sheÂ’s getting ready to go<br>
A knock comes on the door...<br>
<br>
Bang, bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Came down upon her head<br>
Bang, bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Made sure that she was dead<br>
<br>
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again<br>
Teacher gets annoyed<br>
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene<br>
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away<br>
So he waits behind<br>
Writing 50 times Â“I must not be so-o-o-oo...Â”<br>
But when she turns her back on the boy<br>
He creeps up from behind<br>
<br>
Bang, bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Came down upon her head<br>
Bang, bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Made sure that she was dead<br>
<br>
B.C. Thirty-One said Â“we caught a dirty oneÂ”<br>
Maxwell stands alone<br>
Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh<br>
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery<br>
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)<br>
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo<br>
But as the words are leaving his lips<br>
A noise comes from behind<br>
<br>
Bang, bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Came down upon his head<br>
Bang, Bang, MaxwellÂ’s silver hammer<br>
Made sure that he was dead

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me...<br>
She showed me her room, isnÂ’t it good, norwegian wood?<br>
<br>
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere,<br>
So I looked around and I noticed there wasnÂ’t a chair.<br>
<br>
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine.<br>
We talked until two and then she said, Â“ItÂ’s time for bedÂ”<br>
<br>
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh.<br>
I told her I didnÂ’t and crawled off to sleep in the bath<br>
<br>
And when I awoke, I was alone, this bird had flown<br>
So I lit a fire, isnÂ’t it good, norwegian wood.<p>

Only a northern song<p>
If youÂ’re listening to this song<br>
You may think the chords are going wrong<br>
But theyÂ’re not;<br>
He just wrote it like that.<br>
It doesnÂ’t really matter what chords I play<br>
What words I say or time of day it is<br>
As itÂ’s only a Northern song<br>
It doesnÂ’t really matter what clothes I wear<br>
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown<br>
When itÂ’s only a Northern song.<br>
When youÂ’re listening late at night<br>
You may think the band are not quite right<br>
But they are, they just play it like that<br>
It doesnÂ’t really matter what chords I play<br>
What words I say or time of day it is<br>
As itÂ’s only a Northern song.<br>
It doesnÂ’t really matter what clothes I wear<br>
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown<br>
When itÂ’s only a Northern song.<br>
If you think the harmony<br>
Is a little dark and out of key<br>
YouÂ’re correct, thereÂ’s nobody there.<br>
It doesnÂ’t really matter what chords I play<br>
What words I say or time of day it is<br>
And I told you thereÂ’s no one there.

<a name=penny></a>Penny Lane<p>
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs<br>
Of every head heÂ’s had the pleasure to know.<br>
And all the people that come and go<br>
Stop and say hello.<br>
<br>
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,<br>
The little children laugh at him behind his back.<br>
And the banker never wears a mack<br>
In the pouring rain, very strange.<br>
<br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies<br>
I sit, and meanwhile back<br>
<br>
In penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass<br>
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.<br>
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,<br>
ItÂ’s a clean machine.<br>
<br>
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br>
A four of fish and finger pies<br>
In summer, meanwhile back<br>
<br>
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout<br>
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray<br>
And thoÂ’ she feels as if sheÂ’s in a play<br>
She is anyway.<br>
<br>
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,<br>
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim.<br>
And then the fireman rushes in<br>
From the pouring rain, very strange.<br>
<br>
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies<br>
I sit, and meanwhile back.<br>
Penny lane is in my ears and in my eyes.<br>
There beneath the blue suburban skies,<br>
Penny Lane.

Piggies<p>
Have you seen the little piggies <br>
Crawling in the dirt<br>
And for all the little piggies<br>
Life is getting worse<br>
Always having dirt to play around in.<br>
<br>
Have you seen the bigger piggies<br>
In their starched white shirts<br>
You will find the bigger piggies<br>
Stirring up the dirt<br>
Always have clean shirts to play around in.<br>
<br>
In their styes with all their backing<br>
They donÂ’t care what goes on around<br>
In their eyes thereÂ’s something lacking<br>
What they needÂ’s a damn good whacking.<br>
<br>
Everywhere thereÂ’s lots of piggies<br>
Living piggy lives<br>
You can see them out for dinner <br>
With their piggy wives<br>
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.<p>

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.<br>

If the rain comes, if the rain comes.<br>
When the sun shines they slip into the shade<br>
(When the sun shines down.)<br>
And drink their lemonade.<br>
(When the sun shines down.)<br>
When the sun shines, when the sun shines.<br>
Rain, I donÂ’t mind.<br>
Shine, the weatherÂ’s fine.<br>
I can show you that when it starts to rain,<br>
(When the sun shines down.)<br>
EverythingÂ’s the same.<br>
(When the sun shines down.)<br>
I can show you, I can show you.<br>
Rain, I donÂ’t mind.<br>
Shine, the weatherÂ’s fine.<br>
Can you hear me, that when it rains and shines,<br>
(When the sun shines down.)<br>

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music<br>
Any old way you choose it<br>
ItÂ’s got a back beat, you canÂ’t lose it,<br>
Any old time you use it<br>
ItÂ’s gotta be rock roll music<br>
If you wanna dance with me<br>

IÂ’ve got no kick against modern jazz<br>
Unless they try to play it too darn fast<br>
And change the beauty of the melody<br>
Until they sound just like a symphony<br>
<br>
ThatÂ’s why I go for that that rock and roll music<br>

Rocky raccoon<p>
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota<br>
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon<br>
And one day his woman ran off with another guy<br>
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didnÂ’t like that<br>
He said IÂ’m gonna get that boy<br>
So one day he walked into town<br>
Booked himself a room in the local saloon.<br>
<br>
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room<br>
Only to find GideonÂ’s bible<br>
Rocky had come equipped with a gun<br>
To shoot off the legs of his rival<br>
His rival it seems had broken his dreams<br>
By stealing the girl of his fancy.<br>
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil<br>
But everyone knew her as Nancy.<br>
Now she and her man who called himself Dan<br>
Were in the next room at the hoe down<br>
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin<br>
He said Danny boy this is a showdown<br>
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot<br>
And Rocky collapsed in the corner.<br>
<br>
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin<br>
And proceeded to lie on the table<br>
He said Rocky you met your match<br>
And Rocky said, Doc itÂ’s only a scratch<br>
And IÂ’ll be better IÂ’ll be better doc as soon as I am able.<br>
<br>
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room<br>
Only to find GideonÂ’s bible<br>
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt<br>
To help with good RockyÂ’s revival.

Wednesday morning at five oÂ’clock as the day begings<br>
Silently closing her bedroom door<br>
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more<br>
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her hankerchief<br>
Quietly turing the backdoor key<br>
Stepping outside she is free.<br>
She (We gave her most of our lives)<br>
is leaving (Sacraficed most of our lives)<br>
home (We gave her everything money could buy)<br>
SheÂ’s leaving home after living alone<br>
For so many years. Bye, bye<br>
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown<br>
Picks up the letter thatÂ’s lying there<br>
Standing alone at the top of the stairs<br>
She breaks down and cries to her husband<br>
Daddy our babyÂ’s gone.<br>
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly<br>
How could she do this to me.<br>
She (We never though of ourselves)<br>
Is leaving (Never a thought for ourselves)<br>
home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)<br>
SheÂ’s leaving home after living alone<br>
For so many years. Bye, bye<br>
Friday morning at nine oÂ’clock she is far away<br>
Waiting to keep the appointment she made<br>
Meeting a man from the motor trade.<br>
She What did we do that was wrong<br>
Is having We didnÂ’t know it was wrong<br>
Fun Fun is the one thing that money canÂ’t buy<br>
Something inside that was always denied<br>
For so many years. Bye, Bye

<a name=the></a> The ballad of John and Yoko<p>
Standing in the dock at Southampton,<br>
Trying to get to Holland or France.<br>
The man in the mac said, Â“YouÂ’ve got to turn backÂ”.<br>
You know they didnÂ’t even give us a chance.<br>
Christ you know it ainÂ’t easy,<br>
You know how hard it can be.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.<br>
Finally made the plane into Paris,<br>
Honey mooning down by the Seine.<br>
Peter Brown called to say,<br>
Â“You can make it O.K.,<br>
You can get married in Gibraltar, near SpainÂ”.<br>
Christ you know it ainÂ’t easy,<br>
You know how hard it can be.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.<br>
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton,<br>
Talking in our beds for a week.<br>
The newspapers said, Â“Say what you doing in bed?Â”<br>
I said, Â“WeÂ’re only trying to get us some peaceÂ”.<br>
Christ you know it ainÂ’t easy,<br>
You know how hard it can be.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.<br>
Saving up your money for a rainy day,<br>
Giving all your clothes to charity.<br>
Last night the wife said,<br>
Â“Oh boy, when youÂ’re dead<br>
You donÂ’t take nothing with you<br>
But your soul - think!Â”<br>
Made a lightning trip to Vienna,<br>
eating chocolate cake in a bag.<br>
The newspapers said, Â“SheÂ’s gone to his head,<br>
They look just like two gurus in dragÂ”.<br>
Christ you know it ainÂ’t easy,<br>
You know how hard it can be.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.<br>
Caught an early plane back to London.<br>
Fifty acorns tied in a sack.<br>
The men from the press said, Â“We wish you success,<br>
ItÂ’s good to have the both of you backÂ”.<br>
Christ you know it ainÂ’t easy,<br>
You know how hard it can be.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.<br>
The way things are going<br>
TheyÂ’re going to crucify me.

The continuing story of Bungalow
Bill<p>
Hey, Bungalow Bill<br>
What did you kill<br>
Bungalow Bill?<br>
<br>
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun<br>
In case of accidents he always took his mom<br>
HeÂ’s the all American bullet-headed saxon motherÂ’s son.<br>
All the children sing<br>
<br>
Hey Bungalow Bill<br>
What did you kill<br>
Bungalow Bill?<br>
<br>
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies<br>
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise<br>
So Captain Marvel zapped in right between the eyes<br>
All the children sing<br>
<br>
Hey, Bungalow Bill <br>
What did you kill<br>
Bungalow Bill?<br>
<br>
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin<br>
Not when he looked so fierce, his mother butted in <br>
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him<br>
All the children sing<br>
<br>
Hey, Bungalow Bill<br>
What did you kill<br>
Bungalow Bill?

Day after day alone on the hill,<br>
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still,<br>
But nobody wants to know him,<br>
They can see that heÂ’s just a fool, <br>
And he never gives an answer,<br>
But the fool on the hill<br>
Sees the sun going down,<br>
And the eyes in his head,<br>
See the world spinning around.<br>
<br>
Well on his way his head in a cloud,<br>
The man of a thousand voices talking percetly loud<br>
But nobody ever hears him,<br>
Or the sound he appears to make,<br>
And he never seems to notice,<br>
But the fool on the hill . . .<br>
Nobody seems to like him<br>
They can tell what he wants to do.<br>
And he never shows his feelings,<br>
But the fool on the hill . . .

Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream,<br>
It is not dying, it is not dying<br>
<br>
Lay down al thoughts, surrender to the void,<br>
It is shining, it is shining.<br>
<br>
Yet you may see the meaning of within<br>
It is being, it is being<br>
<br>
Love is all and love is everyone<br>
It is knowing, it is knowing<br>
<br>
And ignorance and hate mourn the dead<br>
It is believing, it is believing<br>
<br>
But listen to the colour of your dreams<br>
It is not leaving, it is not leaving<br>
<br>
So play the game Â“ExistenceÂ” to the end<br>
Of the beginning, of the beginning

We were talking-about the space between us all<br>
And the people-who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion<br>
Never glimpse the truth-then itÂ’s far too late-when they pass away.<br>
We were talking-about the love we all could share-when we find it<br>
To try our best to hold it there-with our love<br>
With our love-we could save the world-if they only knew.<br>
Try to realise itÂ’s all within yourself<br>
No-one else can make you change<br>
And to see youÂ’re really only very small,<br>
And life flows within you and without you.<br>
We were talking-about the love thatÂ’s gone so cold and the people,<br>
Who gain the world and lose their soul-<br>
They donÂ’t know-they canÂ’t see-are you one of them?<br>
When youÂ’ve seen beyond yourself-then you may find, peace of mind,<br>

In the town where I was born<br>
Lived a man who sailed to sea<br>
And he told us of his life<br>
In the land of submarines<br>

So we sailed up to the sun<br>
Till we found the sea of green<br>
And we lived beneath the waves<br>
In our yellow submarine<br>

We all live in our yellow submarine,<br>
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine<br>

 <a name=younever></a>You never give me your money
You never give me your money<br>
You only give me your funny paper<br>
and in the middle of negotiations<br>
you break down<br>
<br>
I never give you my number<br>
I only give you my situation<br>
and in the middle of investigation<br>
I break down<br>
<br>
Out of college, money spent<br>
See no future, pay no rent<br>
All the moneyÂ’s gone, nowhere to go<br>
Any jobber got the sack<br>
Monday morning, turning back<br>
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go<br>
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go<br>
Oh, that magic feeling<br>
Nowhere to go<br>
<br>
One sweet dream<br>
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine<br>
Soon weÂ’ll be away from here<br>
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away<br>
One sweet dream came true today<br>
Came true today<br>
Came true today (yes it did)<br>

One two three four five six seven,<br>
All good children go to Heaven
